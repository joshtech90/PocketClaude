# Daily Workflow

Recommended workflow for continued development of PocketClot after
the initial setup is complete (server running on your mini-PC, app
installed on your phone, your own Tailnet FQDN active).

## What lives where

```
                    Mac (dev machine)             Mini-PC (production)
                    ─────────────────             ──────────────────────
PocketClaude/server  ✏️ code edits                🚀 runs as systemd
  ├─ pocket_claude/  master                       read-only copy
  ├─ deploy/         master                       read-only copy
  ├─ data/           — (Mac server stopped)       📦 data authority
  ├─ .env            — (Mac server stopped)       📦 server token
  └─ .venv           macOS binaries               Linux binaries (separate)

PocketClaude/app     ✏️ code edits                —
  └─ app/build/      APK lands here               —
                    → adb install                 → Android device
```

**Rule:** Data (SQLite DB, uploads, service-account JSON, .env) lives
**only on the mini-PC**. The Mac and the repo stay data-free.

## One-time Mac configuration

So the daily deploy knows where to push, add the following to `~/.zshrc`
(or `~/.bashrc`) once:

```bash
export POCKET_CLAUDE_TARGET="me@your-host"                          # SSH target
export POCKET_CLAUDE_PUBLIC_URL="https://your-host.your-tailnet.ts.net"   # public URL
```

Open a new shell and you're ready to go.

---

## Server code update (daily)

When you change a `.py` file:

```
Double-click: Update Mini-PC.command
```

What happens in ~3 seconds:
1. rsync from the Mac repo to `<your-mini-pc>:/opt/pocket-claude/` (code only,
   no data/, no .env, no .venv)
2. If `requirements.txt` changed: `pip install` in the server venv
3. `sudo systemctl restart pocket-claude` (no password prompt thanks to NOPASSWD)
4. Health check via `$POCKET_CLAUDE_PUBLIC_URL/health`

If anything goes wrong, the script prints the last 20 log lines.

### Tail logs in real time
```bash
ssh me@your-host 'sudo -n journalctl -u pocket-claude -f'
```

---

## App code update (daily)

When you change a `.kt` file, connect the Android device via USB:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/PocketClaude/app
./gradlew installDebug && adb shell am start -n de.smartzone.pocketclaude/.MainActivity
```

---

## When should you push to GitHub?

GitHub plays **no role** in the daily loop — the Mac → mini-PC sync runs
directly via rsync, not through `git pull`. But for version tracking and
backup, you should commit regularly:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/PocketClaude
git add -A && git commit -m "…" && git push
```

**Why not a git-based deploy?**
- You'd have to commit + push + ssh + pull after every tiny change →
  ~30 seconds of overhead instead of ~3 seconds
- Local experiments would have to go through the repo first
- The git-pull update path still works as a fallback at any time:
  `ssh me@your-host 'sudo bash /opt/pocket-claude/deploy/helpers/update.sh'`
  — provided the repo was initially deployed via `git clone` (instead of
  rsync). If you need this, run `git clone` once alongside the rsync setup.

---

## Other maintenance actions

### Check server status
```bash
ssh me@your-host 'sudo -n systemctl status pocket-claude'
```

### Tailscale funnel status
```bash
ssh me@your-host 'tailscale funnel status'
```

### Download a backup (DB + uploads)
In the app: *Settings → Back up data → Chat backup → Export* — lands
directly as a ZIP in the Downloads folder of your phone. Encrypted with a
password of your choice.

### Reboot the mini-PC
```bash
ssh me@your-host 'sudo reboot'
```
After 30 seconds everything is back up — systemd handles it. The Tailscale
funnel URL stays the same.

## Tools overview

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Update Mini-PC.command` | Double-click → code + restart, ~3 sec |
| `deploy/push-to-minipc.sh` | What the `.command` calls (handles the systemctl restart) |
| `deploy/install-linux.sh` | First-time setup of a fresh Linux host |
| `deploy/setup-tailscale-funnel.sh` | Set up the tunnel |
| `deploy/migrate-to-server.sh` | One-shot data transfer from old host → new host |
| `deploy/helpers/update.sh` | On the mini-PC: `git pull`-based update (fallback) |
| `deploy/helpers/uninstall.sh` | On the mini-PC: tear everything down |
| `Build & Install PocketClot.command` (app repo) | Push APK to Android device |
| `Find Server URL.command` | Resolve Tailscale URL + copy to clipboard |
| `Deploy to Mini-PC.command` | First-time migration (mostly historical) |

**In the daily loop you'll almost only need `Update Mini-PC.command` and
the app install script.** The rest is setup and emergency tooling.
